Kenooooibiegh!!!!
It's over Anakin, I have the high ground!
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Hello there.
At least you're a master... at getting caught!
You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
Not to worry. We're still flying half a ship.
I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.
Oh, I don't think so.
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
I hate it when he does that.
The truth is often what we make of it; you heard what you wanted to hear, believed what you wanted to believe.
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you.
So uncivilized.
If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
If you define yourself by the power to take life, the desire to dominate, to possess... then you have nothing.
These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.
Skill is the child of patience.
Who is more foolish? The fool or the fool who follows him?
If his ship is as fast as his boasting, we ought to do well.
Remember... the Force will be with you. Always.
I am stronger as part of the Jedi Order than I could ever be alone.
You cannot escape your destiny.
You want to go home and rethink your life.
You were right about one thing, master. The negotiations were short.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?
Wait a minute, how did this happen? We're smarter than this.
No, nothing too fancy.
Always on the move.
I will do what I must.
Oh, not good.
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Another happy landing!
Oh, how the mighty Sith have fallen.
Oh, this is going to be easy.
Don't try it!
My allegiance is to the republic, to democracy!
Your move!
So what I told you is true... from a certain point of view.
