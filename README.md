We came up with the idea of building a Reddit bot that scours /r/prequelmemes for images of Obi-Wan Kenobi and then comments Obi-Wan quotes on posts that contain his face.
The bot, nicknamed "ObIdentifier," uses the praw and face-recognition python libraries to accomplish this.

If you have any comments, concerns, or questions feel free to reach out - easiest way would probably be messaging one of us via reddit (the devs [/u/tvcz](https://www.reddit.com/user/tvcz), [/u/valiantseal](https://www.reddit.com/user/valiantseal/), or the bot itself [/u/ObIdentifier](https://www.reddit.com/user/obidentifier)) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Credit to the makers of the [face-recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) and [praw](https://pypi.org/project/praw/) python libraries for their awesome work, as well as to [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex "sentdex's YouTube channel") for the sample code we used to implement the face-recognition library.

Feel free to fork this code to use for whatever (though I don't know what you could possibly use this for?) or modify it in any way.
If you come up with any improvements you'd like to share, definetly shoot us a pull request. ;D
